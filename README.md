# NexusModSorter
Short Description: Python script to sort a bunch of random Nexus mods


I'm a massive horder of skyrim mods, among other games, so I was looking for a way to sort them all out by mod name without having to do it manually. Well, it took a while to get it all in a version that I think other people can use, but here it is!

How to Use:

1. Make sure all of your mod files are all in one big folder. The mod sorter will not look in sub directories!
2. Run the program and type in the directory that all of your mods are in.
3. Select what game the majority of your mods come from (right now only a handfull of the major games are fully supported
4. Wait

It should sort everything by game and by mod. 

Let me know if you have any problems!
